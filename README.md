The model is trained and saved by running model.py. The model will be saved into the file model.h5.

Tests pictures are located in the folder tests. Running the command 'main.py X', where X is an integer will run the recognition program for the picture X.png. The result will be saved as out_X.png, where the clothing objects and their classes will be pointed out on the output picture.
